End-to-End azure Cloud Data Pipeline  — Azure Data Factory, Azure DevOps, Azure Data LakeGen2, Azure SQL DB, PySpark, Delta Lake, Git

• Engineered and deployed a complete data pipeline on Microsoft Azure, processing data from on-prem SQL sources and real-time
APIs.

• Architected a Medallion Architecture using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, transforming raw data (Bronze), cleaning and validat-
ing it (Silver), and creating aggregated business-ready views (Gold) using PySpark in ADF Mapping Data Flows.

• Implemented dynamic, metadata-driven ADF pipelines for incremental data loading, reducing data processing redundancy and
cost.

• Automated the entire CI/CD process using Azure DevOps, integrating ADF with Git for version control, feature branching, and
pull requests to manage development and deployment.

• Orchestrated complex workflows using ADF Triggers and integrated Azure Logic Apps for automated email alerting on pipeline
